		started the making of a new buy post/feed. got pretty confused as to how that would be done but found old code from previous blogging projects that could guide us

============== Wednesday, January 11th ===============

	- wrote a potential fask feed/post but commented it because it was the end of the period and I didnt have time to test

noahF -- 2017-01-17 13:20
	-Worked on profile page

chloeD -- 2017-01-17 14:02
       - worked on the feed/post functionality

chloeD  -- 2017-01-17 23:29
	- spent a ridiculous amount of time reconfiguring my computer (pip, flask, ve and the like were all royally messed up on mycomputer), but that's all fixed now!
	- found a cool way to implement AJAX into the feed
	- worked on post and feed (it works in theory... I want to meet with sebastian and make sure we're on the same page about how it works (aka I want to verify a form thing, which he was working on in class today -- he'll push tomorrow and we'll merge our work)

============== Wednesday, January 18th ===============

chloeD -- 2017-01-18 09:55
       - waiting on a form from buy.html to make sure code for post
       works (will mess around and do some tests in class)
       - looked at AJAX/Python dymnamic feed demos online (I put some
       examples in app.py, which are commented out to not break the
       program, but my plan is to first make sure the post works
       exactly how we want it, then make the regular feed where you
       have to refresh the page yourself, andthen if we have time and
       the regular feed works with bidding and all that functionality,
       then we can make the feed dynamic)

noahF -- 2017-01-18 10:00
	-working on jQuery to show/hide inputs when user wants to change certain aspects of profile
	
chloeD -- 2017-01-18 14:05
