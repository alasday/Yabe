-"Posted by: <username>" (/post) --> change to username of buyer, not username of person viewing the page (basically, session["username"] --> post_info_whatever_this_dict_is_called["username"]

-"$price - user $price - user" (/bid) --> put a <br> between them
-Make price input area for new bid required (/bid) --> in fact just make this whole page look nicer

-"PAY" (/unpaid) --> spice up the whole /unpaid page, say something like: "Your listing found a seller! Pay now. <Nice button that links to {{sale_link}}>"
