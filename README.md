# Yabe
The name of our project is Yabe, so named because it is reverse eBay. Instead of sellers listing things they wish to sell and buyers bidding higher and higher, buyers will list things they want to buy, and sellers will bid lower and lower. Users will create accounts to buy and sell, and the paypal API will handle most of the payment process.
