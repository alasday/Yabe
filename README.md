## Description
Yabe, so named as the reverse of eBay, is ... the reverse of eBay. Instead of users listing things they wish to sell for buyers to bid higher and higher on, users will list things they want to buy, and sellers will have bidding wars for the lowest price. Users will create accounts to buy and sell items, and sales will be made through PayPal, using the PayPal API.

## How to get started
To run our app, there are a few things you need to get started. Once you clone the repo, from the root of the project run 
`$ python utils/initilize.py`
to initilize the app. This must only be done once. Next, contact the team at Yabe for your PayPal API keys. We will send you a file, keys.txt, which you should place in the root directory of your the project.

Enjoy!
